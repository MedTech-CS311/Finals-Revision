# Problem I:

You are doing an Internship in a fresh Startup delivering Web and Mobile Solutions for multiple Clients.
The first Project you are part of is an Online Banking Solution for a bank willing to Digitalize its services.

The client wants to capitilize on the post COVID era to be available to all its clients everywhere. The System they want to have is composed of:

- A Client Web Interface where clients could login, check their Balances and their Transactions' History, and make money Transfers online
- An Admin Web Interface where Bank Agents could login and track the Users and Transactions in the system

1. In the first Meeting with a Client, you came up with the idea to also include a Mobile App to be used by the bank clients. The client seemed interested by the thought.

   Defend your idea by giving arguments on how important Mobile Development is and what would be the added Value of having this additional Mobile App.

2. Congratulations! The client went for your suggestion and it was added to the Product Requirements.

   The Team Lead asked the whole team to imagine the system and send a Proposal on how the Architecture could be. Your first task would be to make a diagram that describes the system Components and how they are interconnected and gives a suggestion on a Technology that could be used in each part.

- The Mobile App
- The User Dashboard
- The Admin Dashboard
- The Server Side
- The Database

3. The Team had a conversation on what Technology to use for the Mobile App you suggested. Some members suggested to go for _Native Development_. On the other hand, you suggested to opt for _Cross-Platform Development using React Native_. Explain why and what are the benefits of opting for _Cross-Platform Development_ and why React Native?

4. The team agreed to your Suggestion and decided to develop the Application using React Native. They also assigned to you the implementation of this Application.

   Your first task would be to imagine the user experience of the bank clients and give the list of Screens that would be implemented.
